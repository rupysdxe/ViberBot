# ViberBot
This was a small Viber BOT project implemented in Python with the Flask framework to make webhooks 
that can be called by the Viber server if users interacted with Viber bot.

<h4>Tech :</h4>
1. MySQL 
2. Python - Flask


<h4>Features:</h4>

1. Can send multiple messages to all Viber users who have subscribed to the bot at once.

2. Messages can be sent to multiple subscribers by sending them directly to the Viber Bot only from the admin Viber account.

3. Messages sent to Viber Bot from users are routed directly to the ADMIN Viber account.

4. Event information, such as unsubscriptions, subscriptions, and messages sent to BOT, is directly sent to Admin  Viber account.


Note: This was a small project, so I have not used best software development practices such as using modularization to avoid redundancy, and so on.
